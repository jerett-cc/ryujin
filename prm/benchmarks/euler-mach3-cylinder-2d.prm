# Supersonic channel flow past a cylinder in 2D at Mach 3.
#
# The geometry is a disc of diameter 0.5 positioned at coordinates {0.6,0}
# in a channel [0,4] x [-1,1]. On the left inflow boundary Dirichlet
# boundary conditions and on the right outflow boundary "do nothing"
# conditions are enforced. On all other boundaries (top and bottom boundary
# of the channel and the cylinder boundary) slip boundary conditions are
# enforced.
#
# The chosen refinement level 8 corresponds to around 2.36M gridpoints
# (9.44M degrees of freedom), which requires around 25k time steps and runs
# for about (50h / #n_cores) on a modern system.
#
# The final time is set to t = 5.0 and we output a vtk every δt = 0.1. For
# postprocessing the simulation into a nice video set the output frequency
# to δt = = 0.01 which will result in a 25 seconds long video at 20 fps.
