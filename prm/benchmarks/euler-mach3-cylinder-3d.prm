# Supersonic channel flow past a cylinder in 3D at Mach 3.
#
# Computational results for this configuration with 1.8B gridpoints are
# discussed in [1].
#
# The geometry is a disc of diameter 0.5 positioned at coordinates {0.6,0}
# in a channel [0,4] x [-1,1] and extruded into 3d with z in [-1,1] with 4
# layers of hexahedra. On the left inflow boundary Dirichlet boundary
# conditions and on the right outflow boundary "do nothing" conditions are
# enforced. On all other boundaries (top, bottom, front, and back
# boundaries of the channel and the cylinder boundary) slip boundary
# conditions are enforced.
#
# Warning, this is a fairly large computation!
# The chosen refinement level 6 corresponds to around 32M gridpoints (160M
# degrees of freedom), which requires around 6.2k time steps and runs for
# about (600h / #n_cores) on a modern system.
