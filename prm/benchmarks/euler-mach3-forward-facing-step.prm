# Supersonic flow past a forward facing step at Mach 3.
#
# The geometry is a channel with bottom left corner {0,0} and top right
# corner {3,1} but with a step inscribed at position x = 0.6 of height 0.2:
#
#   [0,0.6] x [0,0.2] \cup [0,3] x [0.2,1.0]
#
# On the left inflow boundary Dirichlet boundary conditions and on the
# right outflow boundary "do nothing" conditions are enforced. On all other
# boundaries (top and bottom boundary of the channel includin step) slip
# boundary conditions are enforced.
#
# The chosen refinement level 3 corresponds to around 1.04M gridpoints
# (4.16M degrees of freedom), which requires around 14k time steps and runs
# for about (15h / #n_cores) on a modern system.
#
# The final time is set to t = 4.0 and we output a vtk every δt = 0.1. For
# postprocessing the simulation into a nice video set the output frequency
# to δt = = 0.01 which will result in a 20 seconds long video at 20 fps.
