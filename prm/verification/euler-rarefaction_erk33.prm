#
# Euler (optimized polytropic gas EOS) benchmark:
#
# The rarefaction wave is an analytic solution of the compressible Euler
# equations (with polytropic gas equation of state). See Section 5.3 of
# @cite GuermondEtAl2018 and Section 4.4 in @cite Toro2009. The problem is
# challenging to solve for methods enforcing a minimum priniciple on the
# specific entropy. With strict limiting the convergence rate reduces to 1.
# The best-approximation error for the problem in the L1-norm is 2.
#
# We report the final, normalized L1, L2, L\infty error norms summed up
# over the rho, m_1, and E components.
#
# This configuration uses an explicit ERK(3, 3, 1) timestepping.
# Expected results are reported in euler-rarefaction-erk33.baseline
#
# We expect a convergence rate of around 1.5 in the L1 norm for our choice
# of limiting and bounds relaxation.
